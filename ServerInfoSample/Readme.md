# Platform Backend Practical - IP/Domain Workers

## Goal:
Create an application that integrates multiple services into a useful and timesaving workflow.

## Objectives:
Build an application in a language listed below that provides an API that takes an IP or domain as input and gathers information from multiple
sources returning a single result. Your application must farm individual portions of the lookup to various workers who perform the action. The
application should then combine the results and return a single payload.

## The API should accept:

IP or domain
A list of services to query. This input should be optional with a default list used if none provided.

## The API should then:

Validate input
Break the request into multiple individual tasks
Send those tasks to a pool of 2+ workers. The API must support workers on separate processes/machines/docker containers than the
API.
The workers should then perform the tasks and return the results to the application
The application should wait for all tasks for a request to be completed, combine the results and return
Some suggested services available to query:
GeoIP
RDAP
Reverse DNS
Ping

## Bonus Points:

Add additional services (VirusTotal, open ports, website status, domain availability, etc)
API has a Swagger Spec (if you use REST)
Support partial results on error or rate limit

## What we are looking for:

How you organize your project

## What tooling you use (nuget, npm, etc.)

Creativity, performance, testing
Please implement this practical in C#.
Use this task as a way to show off what kind of developer you are, how you approach problems, how you deal with difficulties and you can come
up with clever solutions. We do not expect a feature complete, production worthy product (though it would be a bonus). We would be just as
happy to have you explain your next steps and how you would approach them.
